# ratbot

mainly written by Ernest Izdebski, a lot of rewritten code by myerfire; ig mention me if you steal my code or smth

Edit the config.py as you wish and create secrets.py file with the variables `token` with the bot's token,
`api_key` with the hypixel api key (irrelevant if not running cogs/hypixel.py), and `weather_api_key` with the 
[weather site](https://openweathermap.org/) (irrelevant if not running cogs/on_member_update/Armenium.py).
Note that running Armenium.py requires an Armenium.json in the same folder with some variables.
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the relevant modules .

i think that's all? the best way to message me is on
